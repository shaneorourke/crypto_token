3. Create Crypto Currency Wallet to hold SOLANA (SOL)
- CMD:sudo apt-get update
- CMD:sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
- CMD:sudo apt install libudev-dev
- CMD:sudo apt install libssl-dev pkg-config -y
- CMD:sudo apt install build-essential -y

3a. Install solana tools
- CMD:sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.8.5/install)"
- exit out of session and log back in (to make sure PATH variables are updated in shell)

3b. Create Wallet
- CMD:solana-keygen new
- enter past passphrase
- Copy and paste somewhere the pubkey (this is the wallets public address)
- Copy and paste somewhere the passphrases (this is import to restore the wallet!) - KEEP THIS!

3c. Check Wallet
- CMD:solana balance 
- should be 0, but there at least

4. Add solana (SOL) to the wallet
- Go to an exchange, buy at least 0.05 SOL

6. Install Solana Token Program (A cli tool to create a SOL token on the SOL blockchain)
- CMD:cargo install spl-token-cli
- This takes a while!

7. Create the token!
- CMD:spl-token create-token
- Copy and Paste Token Address (e.g. Creating token vAdedkjsaksyi78yiu3haskejhiuhAkljn)

8. Create an account for the token
- For the next one replace vAdedkjsaksyi78yiu3haskejhiuhAkljn with your token address 7.2
- CMD:spl-token create-account vAdedkjsaksyi78yiu3haskejhiuhAkljn
- Copy and Paste Token Account (e.g. Creating token 3psjk58dhi7fyw4ih8w7ehfsdkjhsdfsd)


9. MINT Tokens to go in the account
- For the next one replace vAdedkjsaksyi78yiu3haskejhiuhAkljn with your token address 7.2
- Also feel free to mint as many tokens as you like, below mints 1Billion e.g. 1000000000
- EXAMPLE COMMAND: spl-token mint token-address mint-amount token-account
- CMD:spl-token mint vAdedkjsaksyi78yiu3haskejhiuhAkljn 1000000000 3psjk58dhi7fyw4ih8w7ehfsdkjhsdfsd

10. Check minted tokens
- CMD:spl-token accounts

11. Send New Token to another Accounts (I used Phantom Wallet Chrome Extension, you can use Solflare app or soemthing else) - Sending to MYSELF
- Install Phantom Wallet Extension
- SAVE Passphrases!!
- Click on SOL - Deposit and Copy the deposit address e.g. 8jsdljsdkfhwek8soduhfsiuhf
- EXAMPLE COMMAND: spl-token transfer --fund-recipient --allow-unfunded-recipient token-address 1000 deposit-address
- ** Note --fund-recipient (pay to create account wallet if empty)
- ** Note --allow0unfunded-recipient (Allow the above)
- CMD: spl-token transfer --fund-recipient --allow-unfunded-recipient vAdedkjsaksyi78yiu3haskejhiuhAkljn 1000 8jsdljsdkfhwek8soduhfsiuhf
- Check webwallet to make sure deposit was successful

11a. Send to someone elses wallet
- Use the above command 11.7 but use the recipients address as deposit-address. This will send to them
- IT HAS TO BE A SOLANA WALLET ADDRESS - On the SOL blockchain

12. Check Token on solscan
- GO to https://solscan.io/
- paste in the token-address account
- you should see how many tokens are minted
- It should be "unrecognised" as it's not yet realised

13. Mint more tokens? 
- Execute this again:
- CMD:spl-token mint vAdedkjsaksyi78yiu3haskejhiuhAkljn 1000000000 3psjk58dhi7fyw4ih8w7ehfsdkjhsdfsd
- CMD:solana balance
- Should see X more but minus the amount sent to recipient in 11.

14. Create a logo for your token.

- Go to: https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list
- Click on fork (creates a copy of the token list in your account)
- Click on the window (just to select the browser window)
- Press "." (the full stop / period button)
- This will open up VS Code within the browser
- Select "assets" -> Add new folder -> name it the same as your token address 7.2

- go to src/tokens
- copy an existing token and paste at the bottom
- make sure that the json is formated correctly (or the merge will fail)
- change the "address": value to be your token address 7.2
- change the symbol to be what symbol you want e.g. ACDC
- Change logo url to be your logo in github 15.8

- click the "changes icon" (a V with dots on, it's on the left, should have a number next to it) This is OUR changes
- Add a Message - e.g. "Adding X token"

- GO back to the orignal solana labs repo https://github.com/solana-labs/token-list
- Click "Pull Request"
- New Pull Request
- Click "compare across forks"
- Click the "head" and select your version of the token-list 

- Scroll down and click "Create pull request"

- This takes about half an hour for the automation to merge your changes into the solana repo! 

17. Check Token on solscan
